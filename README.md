# :anchor: Microprocessor-Virtual-Lab
Assembly language programs with explanations of an independent virtual laboratory based on IIT-B microprocessor virtual lab curriculum.

There are 10 problems/questions which are programmed using assembly language in 8085 and 8086 separately. 8085 programs are tested in 8085 simulator (Jubin.jar) and 8086 programs are tested on emu8086 compiler.

## Resources
